# Welcome to CSS and SASS assignment

please follow the instructions which you can find in index.html

hello. I would like to explain my website in summary. i opted for the one page mandatory layout, since there was quite a few things which were new to me and i wanted to focus on designing one page in good quality, in case I didn't have time for the other ones.

I also opted for a the most simple way sass folder structure convention: main (app.scss in my case), component, layout and base being the main files. the website itself is very simple, but it resizes and changes layout depending on screen size. hope everything looks okay.
